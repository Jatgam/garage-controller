[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jatgam/garage-controller.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jatgam/garage-controller)

Designed around the [Adafruit Feather Huzzah](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821) board based on ESP8266.

This project is setup to work with PlatformIO.

This is still a work in progress. Most notably, subscription and publishing to mqtt topics still needs to be completed.
